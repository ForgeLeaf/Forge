# Forge
A minimal 2D game framework for desktop, written in Go. 
Forge is designed to be simple and easy to use, while 
still providing the necessary tools for game development. 

**It's a work in progress, and is not yet feature complete.**

Forge aims to be a lightweight alternative to larger game engines, 
and is built with performance in mind. It's meant to be similar to 
the legendary Java framework [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/) and doesn't 
force you to use a specific architecture or design pattern.

## Features
While Forge is still in its early stages, it already has a number 
of features, such as:
- Simple and intuitive APIs
- Cross-platform desktop support (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
- Advanced 2D rendering using OpenGL (with a simple Batch implementation)
- Advanced input handling methods
- Basic audio support (both Music and Sound)
- Minimal geometry and math library
- Minimal scene graph implementation
- Advanced camera support
- Advanced viewport support
- Bitmap font support
- Support for GL-related entities such as:
    - Shaders
    - Textures
    - FrameBuffers

## Goal
The goal of Forge is to allow both beginners and experienced developers 
to create 2D games quickly and easily, without being bound to a specific
architecture or design pattern. The code is written in a way that allows 
you to use it as a library, or as a base for your own game engine.

Forge's main focus is on performance and simplicity, we may also introduce 
support for more platforms in the future, such as mobile (Android, IOS) and 
web (using WebAssembly).

## Getting Started
While nobody is stopping you from using Forge in your own projects, 
we suggest you to wait until we reach a more stable version for production-grade 
code. The framework is still in its early stages, and we are constantly 
adding new features and breaking changes, so the API is not yet stable. 
As of now, the framework has reached a point where it is usable, but we 
are still working on polishing the API. Please check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) 
for more information on the latest changes. The current version of the 
framework is `0.0.8`, you may check the tags for other versions.
